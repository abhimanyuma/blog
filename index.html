  <p>
  I am Abhimanyu, called either Manyu or Coden depending on who I am talking to.
  A graduate of NIT Calicut and IIT Kanpur. Started off with a lot of interest in
  algorithms, still love it, however right now working on building things on the web.
  I currently work at <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> on their
  community side platform.
